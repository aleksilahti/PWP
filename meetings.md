# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 11.2.2021**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### Minutes
* Aleksi presented earlier prototype of the quiz, which was "good motivation".

* Concept drawing was partially even a bit too detailed.
* Text on the other hand was not enough,
more info what are the concepts and what are the properties.
* Which is something that can be taken out as a whole?

* API uses is completely missing,
how they use API, what are their purposes?

* What is the mechanism behind answering?
* It is probably not "pure" REST...
* In the examples at least one was using POST-methods...

* It seems that the API is "big" enough.

* There are enough resources and interactions for the next steps.


### Action points
* API uses section missing

* Concepts; what are concept and what are properties
