# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 11.2.2021**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### Minutes
*Aleksi presented earlier prototype of the quiz, which was "good motivation".

Concept drawing was partially even a bit too detailed.
Text on the other hand was not enough,
more info what are the concepts and what are the properties.
Which is something that can be taken out as a whole?

API uses is completely missing,
how they use API, what are their purposes?

What is the mechanism behind answering?
It is probably not "pure" REST...
In the examples at least one was using POST-methods...

It seems that the API is "big" enough.
Enough resources and interactions for the next steps.
